# InventorySystem

#### A program to take user input to maintain an inventory of their precious metals. It utilizes 4 cpp files and 1 header file. The user will be prompted to choose a precious metal to deposit or withdraw from. The max capacity for each metal is 100. They are allowed to deposit in decimal points. Input validation is also put in place to protect against wrong numbers or letters. It is a beginner program I wrote as I get back into using C++ again. This project was started and influenced by Kaveh Zare, whom I collaborated with on this project. Check out his GitHub!
